- a network consists of two or more entities or objects sharing resources and information.
- a computer network consists of 2 or more comuted device connected to each other to share resources and information .
- network becomes powerful tool when computers communicate and share resources with other computers on the same network or entirely distinct networks.
computer
1. client computer
-- out computer 
3. server computer
-- controls and provides access to resources.
   - have higher RAM , CPU AND STORAGE
- server Rack
   - switch 
   - modem
   - servers 
   - firewall
   - display
why we need of network
- to enhance communication
- share resources 
- facilitate centralized management
- internet
- 
Classification by network geography
- LAN, WAN, 

1. LAN
- local area network
- cover very small area like classroom.
- inexpensive to install 
2. MAN
- metropolitan area network 
- like city 
- the cost of installation and operation is higher
- use high speed such as fiber optics to achieve higher speeds
- CAN = campus area network 
3. WAN
- span larger area other than a single city 
- like one country to another country
- use long distance telecommunication networks for connection , thereby increasing the cost.
- internet is a good example of WAN.
classification based on component roles
1. peer to peer
 - all computers are considered equal.
 - cheap and easy 
 - are popular as home networks and for use in smal campanies.
 - maximum number of peers that can operate here is 10.
 - are
2. server based 
- offers centralized control and is designed for secure operations.
3. client based
- the client acts as a server.
- it is peer to the others 
- the peer computers are not directly connected to each other rather they are connected by the server
### IP/Internet Protocol/ address
it used to lemeleyet andn computer ke and computer
- is a network layer protocol
- is unique identifier

####USAGE OF IP'S 
- used to connect to another computer or network
IP TYPES
based on ip version
1. ip v4
2. ipv6

1. Ipv4
- is 32 bit sequence of 1s and 0s
- to make ip address easier to use , the address is written as four decimal numbers separated by periods.
- this way of writing the address is called the dotted decimal format.
- ip generated by DHCP or manually.
IP STRUCTURE
has four section
- each section is 8 bits long.
- 192.168.123.12 
each section can range from0 to 255
- when you connect to some network an ip address will be generated and given ( automatically by HCP or static way).
- every IP address has two parts:
- network- to identify the network
- host- to identify the user
- 192.168.123.12
- network.network.network.hostthe first host address is called GATEWAY ADDRESS

There are 5 classes of private IP address A B C D E
CLASS A= Government
CLASS B= medium companies
CLASS C 

CLASS A
- have 24 bits of space for host 
- 10.2.3.1
- network.host.host.host
- used to lemeyaz bzu computerochn 
- number of hosts per network
- number of networks 126
- first octet adddress range 0-127
- high order bits 
- 16,777,216
CLASS B
have 16 bit of space for hosts
- network . network .host . host
- have 65,536 number of hosts per network
- have 16,384 number of networks
- first octet address range 128-191
CLASS C
have 8 bit space for hosts and 24 bit of network
- network. network. network. host
- no of hosts per network
- 2,097,152 no of networks
- first octet 192-223
- high order bits 110
- used for our home, school , work space
RESERVED IP ADDRESS
- can not be assigned to devices on a network.
- addresses begining 127 are reserved for loopback and internal testing(for localhost).
- an IP address that has binary 0s in all host bit position is reserved for the network address . 
- An IP address that has binary 1 or 255 in all host bit position is reserved for the broadcast address.
resereved
- 0.0.0.0
- 127.0.0.0

IPV6 (internet protocol version6)
- is 128 bit alpha numeric long value that identifies an endpoint devices in IPV6 network.
- format of an IPV6 address.
- be hulet netib new yemileyew
- Format of an IPV6 address:
- FE80:CD00:0000:0CDE:1257:0000:211E:729C
- ALPHANumeric
- separated by colon:
- IP generated automatically
- the main difference is IP space(host holding)
- ipv4 holds 32 bit ip address but ipv6 holds 128 bit ip address.
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC IP ADDRESS
- any host have 2 different IP'S
- PUBLIC IP :
- is an ip address that is given to the host on the WAN network
- kenya network wuchi yalu yemiyakun 
- private ip 
- is ip that is given to the host on LAN NETWORK.
- internet and intranet
public ip 
curl ifconfig.me
private ip 
ipconfig

ipv4 = eyanesu new 
why do we need ipv6
- lack of ipb4 even in class A is not enough
- ISP- internet yemiyaerbuln 
- ISP in ethiopia are ethiotelecom, safaricom
- enesu up geztew new
- IP ADDRESS are limited, and expensive
- in our country we don't have that much IP'S there for many people have the same IP ADDRESS.
- location of person 
- unique identifier
- do people hack with IP address
- static and dynamic DHCP
- dynamic kehone hack ayderegm
- Client computer and mobile use dynamic assigning by default.
- changed when you restart or rest ur phone or router.
- lack of ipv4(poor country)
NAT(network address translation)
- it translates public id to private id.
