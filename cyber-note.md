*introduction to linux

operating system is software part of the computer that helps to work on . 
it contains - kernel
         - softwares
         - desktop environment 
         - file extensions 
         - window manager
linux by it self is only kernel . linux with GNU is operating system. 

In linux there are three type of desktop environment 
1.mate 
2.genome (have beautiful feature)
3.KDE plasma (similar to window )
4.XFCE

which desktop environment is best 
-speed depend on 
-  animation 
- high graphics 
- quality 
-*window manager*
-i3-window-manager - to perform many things once 
- it can be installed using `sudo apt install i3

*why linux *

- for speed 
- most used (by many websites , servers , systems).
- it has most hacking tools.
- most secured.
- it is open source there is no any organization that controls linux.

***linux distribution*(distro)**

- Distro- are modified linux in kernels, type of operating systems with different 
     - linux kernel
     - packages(GNU)
     - package manager(file manager)
     - Desktop UI(desktop environment)
 - there are many linux distros 
     - Debian 
         - kalin linux
         - ubuntu
         - parrot
    - Arch
         - Black arch
         - Garuda
    - Fedora
    - Red Hat
    - Gentoo
    - Android
- ubuntu is for specifix purpose 

*what is best for hackers?*
        - kali linux
        - parrot os
        - Garuda 
        - Black Arch
      for begineer kali linux and parrot os are best 
    
    
   1. *kali linux 
-  is debian based  or debian derived linux distribution for digital forensic and penetration testing. it is maintained and funded by offensive security.
- desktop envronment = XFCE
- package managers = APT
- shell = ZSH
   2. *parrot 
- is based on debian with a focus on security, privacy and development.
- desktop env= MATE
- package manager =APT
- shell = BASH
3. *Garuda 
- based on arch linux
- desktop env = KDE PLASMA
- package manager= packman
- shell = fish
*do windows have distros?*
- no because window is not an open source so people won't use / edit it.

how can we use it(linux)?
a. main os/main boot 
     -  using only linux by discarding window os.
b. dualBoot / 2 in 1 
    - when we boot our pc it asks as to choose an os we have to shut down to change the os
c. Live boot 
 - by using flash - when we plug the flash in the operating system will be linux 
 - the flash can be above 8GB
D. Cloud terminal 
https://www.terminal.org
E. virtual machine 
- medium processor pc
- using vm software 
- it is like on one computer we can use two or more computers .
- we need to enable *virtualization*
- virtualization help us to use window and linux together.
- this is a method how it allocates out using memory to the virtual machines. 
- softwares that gives us this ability 
      - HyperV
      - ZEMY
      - virtual Box - oracle
      - VMware(common)

F. WSL V2
- for low performance computers
- it helps us to use linux shell on window cmd
- window subsystem for linux 
G. Termux - Android 
- to use linux for android phones 
- for running simple codes 

step to 
-installing kali linux on window
