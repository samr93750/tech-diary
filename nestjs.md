NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side applications. It is heavily inspired by Angular and uses TypeScript, which makes it a great choice for developers familiar with that ecosystem.

Some key features of NestJS include:

1. **Modular Architecture**: NestJS encourages a modular approach to application development, allowing you to organize your code into reusable and testable modules.
    
2. **Dependency Injection**: NestJS has a powerful dependency injection system that helps manage the dependencies between different components of your application.
    
3. **Routing and Controllers**: NestJS provides a robust routing system and controller layer, making it easy to map HTTP requests to your application's logic.
    
4. **Middleware and Pipes**: NestJS supports middleware and pipes, which are used to transform and validate data before it reaches your application's logic.
    
5. **Exception Handling**: NestJS has built-in exception handling mechanisms, making it easier to manage and handle errors in your application.
    
6. **Testing**: NestJS comes with built-in support for unit and end-to-end testing, making it easier to write and maintain high-quality code.
    
7. **Scalability**: NestJS is designed to be scalable, with support for features like WebSockets, microservices, and distributed architectures.
