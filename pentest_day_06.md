### Network Hacking

and network lay penetration mesrat.
network hacking is gathering and exploiting of networks.
- includes
- information gathering
- sniffing
- attacking
- there are different touls
- Nmap
- ping 
Ping
- widely used 
- mekotater enchilalen 
- bemn yahl gize yilak yemilewn mekotater enchilalen 
- count(-c)
- package size (-s)
- ping 8.8.8.8 -c 2(hulete bcha yilikal )
- ping -s 100 8.8.8.8
- variants of ping
- fping : to ping multiple hosts simultaneously.
- nping: allowing more advanced packet crafting and timing tests.
- hping

Network sniffing (networkn meselel )
- process of monitoring and capturing all the packets 
- sewoch miyaregutn neger mayet
- networkn monitor mareg

Types of sniffing
1. passive sniffing
- is not altered 
- for listening only 
- it works on Hub devices. the traffic is sent to all the ports.
1. Active Sniffing
- also altered 
- switched based network 
to sniff on Networks , there are many tools we can use
- wire shark 
- passive monitoring
- is protocol analyzer
- capture and record network traffic and save it in cap/pcap file 
- supports both live and offline analysis

- ip.src == 10.32.11.220 && ip.dst==162.33.22.101
- ip.stc eq 10.21.11.220 and ip.dst eq 162.22.32.101
- ip.src ==10.32.11.220 || ip.src == 262.23..32.12
- we can follow the packets steps 
- tcp dump
- sudo tcpdump -i <interface> 
- sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
- Tshark
- - Tshark is a command line tool like the wireshark 
- microsoft Message Analyzer
- network miner
